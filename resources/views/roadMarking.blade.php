                                <b>DIVIDING LINE VS LANE LINE</b> <br />A "Lane" is the space between two lines (or a line and the kerb) painted to divide the road into two or more lines of traffic travelling in the same direction. A "Laned" road therefore has at least 2 Lanes. A road without marked lanes is an "Unlaned" road regardless of its width. A "Multi-lane" Road is a one-way road or a two-way road with 2 or more marked lanes that are on the side of the dividing strip or median strip (road divider) where the driver is driving and for the use of vehicles travelling in the same direction.

                                <b>Solid Lane Line</b> <br />The lanes near intersections are often marked by Solid Lane Lines where no lane changing is permissible.Â <br>
                                The traffic driving along such lanes bound by solid lines has to move along the same direction or the direction indicated by road marking arrows thus a No-Lane changing zone is created near intersection to prevent last minute change of direction by the traffic, that may obstruct the smooth flow of traffic &amp; cause accidents. Motorists are expected to change lanes while driving in the Lane Change Zone (marked by lanes with broken lines) so that they are in the appropriate line when they enter the No Lane Changing Zone near the intersection. (marked by Solid Lane Lines) . The red car in the illustration is committing an offence.
