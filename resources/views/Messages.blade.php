Through constant implementation of innovative ideas, training, performance evaluation and introspection the Faisalabad Police should strive to fine tune its efforts to serve the Region. The Faisalabad Police should continuously interact with the members of the community, by whatever means possible, so that it is able to get the feedback that is so important and necessary to make it responsive to community needs. I hope that people will enjoy visiting the website and benefit from it. I also hope that this interaction would enable the Faisalabad Police to improve its services and fullfil the guidelines of W/IGP about community Policing.

                        <p  style="text-align: justify"> It is a great honor for me to be appointed as CPO Faisalabad since it is third largest district which means bigger challenges and greater responsibility. Throughout my carrier as Police Officer, I have tried my level best to utilize all my skills, efforts and honesty to deliver to people. I am aware of the gigantic challenges and limited and insufficient resources but I strongly believe that if there is a will there is a way. I will personally make sure that all the complainants are treated with respect, regardless of their social status by the concerned police rank and file. I will also make sure that all complaints are appropriately addressed. I also want to let you know that I am personally available in my office to listen to the complaints of all ranks and file. The role of civil society in the elimination of crime is always very essential and it definitely facilitate police to get into the bottom of affairs. So, I request you to be vigilant of your surroundings and get us informed about any suspicious activity or occurrence of any illegal or criminal activity. We assure you to maintain your confidentiality. May God help me to perform my duties honestly and justly. May God help us to make our country the safest place on the earth. (Aameen)
